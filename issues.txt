Bugs:

TODO:
    - rename project from asterTake2
    - The floating direction of lines after an ansteroid/ship is destroyd should be correlated to the objects speed before it was destroyed
    - better colisions
    - make bullets larger and their elipses smaller
    - when ship is respawned the asteroids should move away slowly
    - inform the player that he has some new weapon

ideas:
    - autoaim bullets can be also called "magnetic bullets"
